Tasks 2-4 for Code Foo 7 Internship</br>
</br>
Task 1:</br>
Link is with email</br>
</br>
Task 2:</br>
PDF is attached with answer to question</br>
</br>
Task 3:</br>
The logic behind my Task 3 solution was as follows:</br>
</br>
1.Code foo class would be the main class that would be used to solve the grid</br>
    a.Created a 2 key Hashmap which would act as grid for the random numbers and an ArrayList of Nodes which will be added as neighbors to each node</br>
    b.When object is created the createGrid() method is called which creates the 3x3 grid and calls the getNeighbors function</br>
    c.The getNeighbors() function gets the neighbors from each node in the grid and pushes them into each node's ArrayList neighbors</br>
    d.The solve method is supposed to solve each Node ****NOT FINISHED****</br>
    </br>
2.Node Class- Holds all data neccessary for each node</br>
   -Holds an ArrayList of Nodes which is the neighbors </br>
   -This class also has a solve method which would find equations equaling to the area recursively by iterating through the neighbors if it is less than 9.****NOT FINISHED****</br>
</br>
 Question 1: If the program was fully completed, the way it was set up should have made the program be able to scale well. All that would be required is to change the limits of some of the for loops throughout the program.</br>
